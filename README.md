# Hello-World
This will be a placement of ideas, brainstorming, progression, resources, and future developments.
Howdy Homosapiens;

My respresention of myself, First of alll, my name is Animarum I originated from Oxnard, California.
I was born there but not raised there, I was actually raised in a small town but slowly advancing to something, that town is called Heyburn,Idaho.
I am now transitioning from a meat eater to a vegetarian, been at it for almost two months.
I don't do drugs for some reason something about me just tells me drugs is'nt something to do right now.
Another thing about me is I love money but I can't seem figure what I love doing so I decided to try coding as a hobby and hoping to like it, so far it is an interesting experience and would be fun to mess around create something with it.
